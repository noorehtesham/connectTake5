 The Connect study will be conducted within a set of integrated health care systems, with electronic medical records (EMRs), a passive follow-up system that is both cost effective and thorough. Consented participants ages 40-65 with no history of invasive cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer from participating health systems will complete an online questionnaire at baseline and periodically throughout the duration of follow-up. Passive follow-up via tumor registries and EMRs will provide outcome information for cancers and their precursors. Blood, urine and saliva samples will be collected at baseline and repeatedly during follow-up in local clinics. Additional biological specimens including fecal and tissue specimens will be collected. This state-of-the-art cohort will be built with an efficient, flexible and integrated infrastructure that makes the most of modern interoperability standards in order to serve as a research workhorse for future generations of scientists at the NCI and across the extramural research community.
